# RimTalk-Quests

> **Dynamic AI-powered quest generation for RimWorld**

A RimWorld mod that extends [RimTalk](https://github.com/juicycleff/RimTalk) to generate context-aware, AI-powered quest descriptions using large language models.

## 📋 About

RimTalk-Quests intercepts RimWorld's quest generation system and replaces static quest descriptions with dynamic, narrative-rich content generated by AI. By reusing RimTalk's model configuration and API infrastructure, this mod creates unique quest narratives that adapt to your colony's situation.
