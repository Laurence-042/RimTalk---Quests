	<description>Dynamic AI-powered quest generation using RimTalk's AI integration!

This mod extends RimTalk to intercept quest generation and create dynamic, context-aware quest descriptions using AI. Every quest becomes unique with AI-generated narratives that adapt to your colony's situation.

Key Features:
• AI-generated quest descriptions that feel natural and immersive
• Reuses RimTalk's model configuration (Google Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)
• Seamlessly integrates with RimWorld's quest system
• Context-aware narratives based on your colony's state

Requirements:
• RimTalk must be installed and configured with an API key
• This mod will use your existing RimTalk AI settings
